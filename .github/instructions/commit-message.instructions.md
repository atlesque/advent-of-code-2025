# Commit message instructions

- Use Conventional Commits format
- Use one of following prefixes:
  - `feat`: for new features
  - `fix`: for bug fixes
  - `docs`: for documentation changes
  - `refactor`: for code refactoring that does not change functionality
  - `test`: for adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: for maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies)
- The commit message should look like this:
  ```
  feat: add new component for user profile
  fix: handle edge case in user authentication
  docs: update README with new setup instructions
  refactor: improve error handling in API calls
  test: add unit tests for new component
  chore: update dependencies to latest versions
  ```
